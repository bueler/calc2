========

Course materials for Math F252X Calculus II (section 001) in Spring 2022 at University of Alaska Fairbanks.  See the website at

[bueler.github.io/calc2](https://bueler.github.io/calc2/)

The design of this site is mostly copied from [my MATH 302 site in Spring 2019](https://bueler.github.io/math302/), and that one in turn is derived from the [coordinated Calculus I (MATH 251) site](https://uaf-math251.github.io/).  The Calculus I site is an original [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) design by [David Maxwell](https://damaxwell.github.io/).

## Exams

The table below gives the date and coverage for upcoming Exams.  <b>The best guide to the content of an Exam is the Quizzes leading up to the Exam, and also the [Homework assignments](homework.html).</b>  See the [Schedule](schedule.pdf).

Links to the Exams themselves ("blank"), and their solutions, will appear here the day after they occur.

### Practice problems for Midterm 1

Your best guide to what Midterm 1 is like is to look at all the previous Quizzes, and the Homework problems.  However, while the Quizzes did not cover sections 3.3 and 3.4, these sections <b>are</b> on Midterm 1.

The following Practice Exam, found on the web, is not perfectly aligned to our schedule/sections but it is reasonably close.
* [Practice Problems for Midterm 1 (SUNY Stony Brook)](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~ddudko/mat132-fall21/Midterm1Practice.pdf) <em><-- ignore Problem 6</em>
  * [Solutions to above Practice Problems (SUNY Stony Brook)](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~ddudko/mat132-fall21/Midterm1PracticeSol.pdf)

### Final Exams from previous semesters

The material on these old Final Exams is close to, but not perfectly reflective of, what will be on our Final Exam this semester.  In fact, I will build our Final by looking at the kinds of problems I asked on Homework, Quizzes, and Midterm Exams.

## Exams

The table below gives the date and coverage for upcoming Exams.  <b>The best guide to the content of an Exam is the Quizzes leading up to the Exam, and also the [Homework assignments](homework.html).</b>  See the [Schedule](schedule.pdf).

Links to the Exams themselves ("blank"), and their solutions, will appear here the day after they occur.

### Final Exams from previous semesters

The material on these old Final Exams is close to, but not perfectly reflective of, what will be on our Final Exam this semester.  In fact, I will build our Final by looking at the kinds of problems I asked on Homework, Quizzes, and Midterm Exams.

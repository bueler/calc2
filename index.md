Welcome to the homepage of **Math F252 Calculus II** (section 001), Spring 2022, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

#### Instructor:  [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/) ([elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu))

I hold [office hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm) in Chapman 306C.

### Getting Started

* Read the [Syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

* See the [Schedule](schedule.pdf).  Check it often to find out what happens next!

* The [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049) is important!  Go there for your grades, solutions to [Homework](homework.html), [Quizzes](quizzes.html), and [Exams](exams.html), and a link to Gradescope for submitting [Homework](homework.html).

* For the [Homework](homework.html), the solutions are available in advance, so you have no excuse for getting less than perfect scores!  The grader will assess your Homework for completion.  Find the solutions at the [Canvas page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049).

* You will need to scan and upload each [Homework](homework.html) set as a single PDF file in Gradescope.  (Link on the [Canvas page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049)!)  See the [Tech Help](techHelp.html) page for help on that job.

### Resources

* The [Math & Stat Tutoring Lab](https://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/index.php) is **open** for in-person tutoring and online tutoring!  You can [sign up for online tutoring](https://fairbanks.go-redrock.com/).

* The [Videos](videos.html) might help.  It is a week-by-week, curated list of possibly-useful videos from the web.

* The [Quizzes](quizzes.html) and [Exams](exams.html) pages include old versions with solutions.  (However, they are not perfectly aligned with our course.)

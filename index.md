## **DRAFT! DRAFT! DRAFT!**

Welcome to the homepage of **Math F252 Calculus II** (section 001) in Spring 2022.

#### Instructor:  [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/) ([elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu))

I am in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).  I hold [office hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm) in Chapman 306C.

### Getting Started

* Read the [Syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

* See the [Schedule](schedule.pdf).  Check it often to find out what happens next!

* FIXME

### Resources

* The [Math & Stat Tutoring Lab](https://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/index.php) is **open** for in-person tutoring and online tutoring!  You can [sign up for online tutoring](https://fairbanks.go-redrock.com/).

* The [Quizzes](quizzes.html) and [Exams](exams.html) pages include old versions with solutions.  However, they used a previous textbook, and are not perfectly aligned.

### Important Links

* [Canvas course page]() (grades and solutions)

* For information on scanning and uploading Homework to Canvas/Gradescope see the [Tech Help](techHelp.html) page.

## Homework

**Warning!** DRAFT content for now!

### How Homework works

  * All problems come from our online textbook: [openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2)
  * Homework is due by 11:59PM on the due date shown on the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf).
  * Turn in your homework via Gradescope, which is accessed via [Canvas](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049).
    * See the [Tech Help page](techHelp.html) for scanning/uploading advice.
  * Answers to odd problems are linked from the online text, and are in the back of the paper textbook.
  * Complete solutions to all problems will be posted in our Canvas site after the homework is due.  Some solutions to odd problems can be found in the [Student Solutions Manual](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2?Student%20resources).
  * Homework will be graded on completion and effort.
  * Since your work is graded based on completion, you should get 100% on your
homework!

### Don't piss-off the grader
  * Put your name and the title "Homework x.y" on the top of the first page.
  * Number all problems, and their parts, as they are in the textbook.
  * _Legibly_ write the problems in order, and space things so they are easy to find.
  * Follow directions.  When you are asked for an explanation, make sure to give one!
  * Turn your homework in on time or in advance.

### Making Homework effective for you
  * Attempt all problems in a particular section before looking at answers/solutions.
  * After working the problems, check your answers and re-attempt any that are incorrect.  Do not look at the solutions until you have attempted the problem twice on your own.
  * Attempt all problems at least two days.  This way you can ask questions if you don't understand!
  * Its pathetic to _start_ by copying the solution.
  * Ask for help when you have questions.  [Math Lab?](https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/)

## Homework

  * The problems, listed in the table below, come from our textbook: [openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2)
  * Homework is due by 11:59PM on the due date shown on the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf).
  * Turn in your homework via Gradescope, which is accessed via [Canvas](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049).
    * See the [Tech Help page](techHelp.html) for scanning/uploading advice.
  * Complete solutions to are posted at the [Canvas site](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7049).
  * Additional solutions to some odd-numbered problems can be found in the [Student Solutions Manual](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2?Student%20resources).
  * Homework will be graded on completion and effort.  You should get 100% on your homework!

### Don't piss-off the grader
  * Write your name and the title "Homework x.y" on the top of the first page.
  * Number all problems, and their parts, as they are in the textbook.
  * _Legibly_ write the problems in order, and space things so they are easy to find.
  * Follow directions.  When you are asked for an explanation, make sure to give one!
  * Turn your homework in on time.

### Making Homework effective for you
  * Attempt all problems _before_ looking at answers/solutions.
  * After working the problems, check your answers and re-attempt any that are incorrect.
  * Attempt all problems at least two days in advance.  This way you can ask questions if you don't understand!
  * Its pathetic to _start_ by copying the solution.
  * Ask for help, in lecture, the [Math Lab](https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/), or in my [Office Hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm).
